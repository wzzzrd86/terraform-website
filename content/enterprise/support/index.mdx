# Support for Terraform Enterprise

If some aspect of Terraform Enterprise is not working as
expected, please reach out to support for help.

## Email

You can engage HashiCorp support via the web portal at <https://support.hashicorp.com> or
by email at <support@hashicorp.com>. Please make sure
to use your organization email (not your personal email) when contacting us so
we can associate the support request with your organization and expedite our
response.

## Diagnostics

For most technical issues, HashiCorp support will ask you to include diagnostic
information in your support request. To ensure the required information is included,
Terraform Enterprise can automatically generate a support bundle including logs and configuration details.

### Downloading the Support Bundle

Diagnostic information is available via in the installer dashboard on port 8800 of your installation.

-> **Note**: For [Terraform Enterprise Active/Active](/enterprise/install/automated/active-active) implementations the
installer dashboard is disabled. Support bundles can instead be generated and saved to the configured
object storage location by executing this command from the command line on a node instance:

```
tfe-admin support-bundle
```

This will create a support bundle from every node in the cluster.

On the dashboard, click on the Support tab:

On the next page, click the _Download Support Bundle_ button which will download the support bundle directly to your web browser.
